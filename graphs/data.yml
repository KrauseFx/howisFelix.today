  description: "Visualization of the number of data entries in [FxLifeSheet](https://github.com/KrauseFx/FxLifeSheet) over the last 10 years, and where the data came from."
  takeaways:
  - Before 2018, the only data used was [RescueTime](https://rescuetime.com) and [Foursquare Swarm](https://swarmapp.com) location data
  - Once I started the [FxLifeSheet project](https://github.com/KrauseFx/FxLifeSheet), I manually tracked around 75 data entries every day, ranging from mood, sleep, to fitness inputs
  - I was able to retrospectively fetch the historic weather data based on my location on a given day

  - "I walk more than twice as much when I'm in New York, compared to any other city"
  - "In NYC I had the general rule of thumb to walk instead of taking public transit whenever it's less than 40 minutes. I used that time to call friends & family, or listen to audio books"
  - "Although Vienna is very walkable, the excellent public transit system with subway trains coming every 3-5 minutes, has caused me to walk less"

The resting heart rate is measured by the [Withings Scanwatch](https://www.withings.com/us/en/scanwatch) while sleeping, and indicates how hard your heart has to work while not being active.

  takeaways:
  - "I started my lean bulk (controlled weight gain combined with 5 workouts a week) in August 2020"
  - "My resting heart rate went from 58bpm to 67bpm from August 2020 (**+9bpm**) to March 2021 with a weight gain of **+8.5kg** (+19lbs)"
  - "The spike in resting heart rate in July & August 2021 was due to bars and nightclubs opening up again in Austria"
  - "After a night of drinking, my resting/sleeping heart rate was about 50% higher than after a night without any alcohol"
  - "The spike in resting heart rate in Oct/Nov/Dec 2021 was due to having bronchitis and a cold/flu, not getting correct treatment early enough"

  takeaways:
  - During the COVID lockdowns I tended to stay healthier. This may be due to not going out, no heavy drinking, less close contact with others, etc. which resulted in me having better sleep.
  - Usually during excessive traveling I get sick (cold/flu)
  - Q4 2021 I had bronchitis, however, I didn't know about it at the time and didn't get proper treatment
  - Overall I'm quite prone to getting sick (cold/flu)

  takeaways:
  - Tracking macros precisely is the best way to lose/gain weight at a controlled and healthy speed
  - When I first started tracking macros, additionally to already working out regularly, is when I started seeing the best results
  - It takes a lot of energy to be consistent, but it's worth it, and it will make you feel good (e.g. feeling good about using a spoon to eat plain Nutella if you have the macros left)
  - Gaining and losing weight is pretty much math, if you track your macros and body weight

  description: "Inspired by a [Reddit finance commnunity](https://old.reddit.com/r/PFPorn), I had been creating annual money flow charts to clearly see how much money I earned, where I spent how much, and how much I saved. The chart below isn't mine (for privacy reasons), but just an example I created."
  takeaways:
  - "**Not owning an apartment, and [living in Airbnbs as a nomad](/blog/one-year-nomad) I actually spent less money.** This was due to not having to buy any furniture, appliances, etc. but also because the number of items I could by for myself was limited, as everything was limited to be able to fit into 2 suitcases. Additionaly I didn't have to pay any rent whenever I traveled for my job, or during conferences."
  - Misc. subscriptions/expenses are adding up quickly
  - Having an End-Of-Year summary from your credit card provider, and always using your card when possible, is a great way to get those numbers
  - Creating this chart is still a lot of work, as you have to keep in mind that some expenses are not solely yours, but you might have covered for a group (e.g. booked a larger Airbnb), or got reimbursed
